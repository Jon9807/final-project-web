# Project Summary
Our site is on Norse mythology. It covers the chief gods such as Odin, Thor, and Freyja, retells the principal myths, and explains cultural elements such as symbols and rituals. Each section is arranged in a manner that visitors can simply browse through the various aspects of Norse culture.
We chose this topic because Norse mythology continues to affect literature, film, and video games even today. It's an interesting subject, and we wanted to put together a website that lays the information out in a readable way and makes it available to everyone who is a fan of the ancient stories.
