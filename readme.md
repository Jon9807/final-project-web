## Project Summary

Our site is on Norse mythology, which is under Mythology / Folklore. It covers the chief gods such as Odin, Thor, and Freyja, retells the principal myths, and explains cultural elements such as symbols and rituals. Each section is arranged in a manner that visitors can simply browse through the various aspects of Norse culture. The content relates to the category through its focus on mythic figures that are central to Norse folklore and cultural identity.

## Key Takeaways
The theme structure we learn in class helps us organize each page of the site. Blocks make it easy to add and arrange content, especially for displaying the different Norse gods. Widgets help us add extra content like images or navigation. These tools keep the site consistent and easy to update.
