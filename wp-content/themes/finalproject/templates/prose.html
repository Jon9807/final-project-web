    <p>The Edda is our richest treasure trove of Norse mythology--starting with a creation myth, passing through the struggle of the gods, giants, dwarves, and elves for survival and supremacy, and ending in the&nbsp;<em>Ragnarok</em>, a final all-engulfing battle wherein the world itself is destroyed. Norse mythology has captured many imaginations, and inspired epics including Wagner''s&nbsp;<em>The Ring</em>&nbsp;and J. R. R. Tolkien''s&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>The&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Prose Edda</em></strong>, also known as the&nbsp;<em>Younger Edda, Snorri''s Edda</em>&nbsp;and, historically, simply as&nbsp;<em>Edda</em>, was written in Old Norse in Iceland during the thirteenth century. In 1220, Snorri Sturluson, a respected poet, parliamentarian, and a visitor to the royal court of Norway, decided to compile the myths and poetic conventions of Norse mythology before they vanished under the influence of Christianity and the verse forms of Europe. The result is the&nbsp;<em>Prose Edda,&nbsp;</em>a unique glimpse of early Norse mythology.</p>
